## `max_connections` vs RAM

The maximum number of simultaneous connections in Aiven for MySQLÂ®
depends on how much RAM your service plan offers and is fixed for each
service plan (**Hobbyist**, **Startup**, **Business**, **Premium**, or
any other plan available under a specific cloud provider.)

:::note
Independent of the plan, an `extra_connection` with a value of `1` is
added for the system process.
:::

## Plans under 4 GiB

For plans under 4 GiB of RAM, the number of allowed connections is per
GiB:

${max\_connections} =$

:::note[Example]
With 2 GiB of RAM, the maximum number of connections is
${max\_connections} =$ x 2 + 1
:::

## Plans with 4 GiB or more

For plans higher or equal to 4 GiB, the number of allowed connections is
per GiB:

${max\_connections} =$

:::note[Example]
With 7 GiB of RAM, the maximum number of connections is
${max\_connections} =$ x 7 + 1
