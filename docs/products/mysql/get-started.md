title: Getting started with Aiven for MySQL®
---

Aiven for MySQL® services are managed from [Aiven
Console](https://console.aiven.io/).

## Start a service

1.  Start an Aiven for MySQL service by following the steps in
    [this article](/docs/platform/howto/create_new_service).

    Upon creating a service, the view returns to the service list, where
    the new service is shown with an indicator that it is being created.

2.  Select the service name in the list to go to the **Overview** page.

    This view shows the connection parameters for your MySQL service and
    its current status.

3.  On the **Overview** page, select **Service settings** from the
    sidebar to access the **Advanced configuration** section and make
    changes to the service configuration, even while the service is
    being built.

    You can find the available configuration options in the
    [reference article](/docs/products/mysql/reference/advanced-params).

The status indicator says **Rebuilding** while the service is being
created. Once the service is up and running, the light changes to green
and the indicator says **Running**.

:::note
Services typically start in a couple of minutes, the performance between
clouds varies and it can take longer under some circumstances.
