title: Topics included in a replication flow
---

When
[defining a replication flow](/docs/products/kafka/kafka-mirrormaker/howto/setup-replication-flow) you need to define which topics in the source Apache KafkaÂ®
cluster to include or exclude from the cross-cluster replica.

The **topics** parameter dictates which topics to include in the replica
and can be provided as [list of regular expressions in Java
format](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html).
The same is also valid for the **topics blacklist** parameter defining
which topics to exclude.

## Example: topic inclusion and exclusion regular expressions

If you need to define a replication flow including the topic
`warehouse.operations` and any topic starting with `customer.`, but
excluding the topic `customer.support` then the following regular
expression can be used:

-   **Topics**: `customer\..*` and `warehouse\.operations`
-   **Topics Blacklist**: `customer\.support`
