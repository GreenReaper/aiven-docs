title: Renew and Acknowledge service user SSL certificates
---

In every Aiven for Apache KafkaÂ® service, when the existing service user
SSL certificate is close to expiration (approximately 3 months before
the expiration date), a new certificate is automatically generated,
including the renewal of the private key.

During the renewal process, both the SSL certificate and its
corresponding private key are regenerated. This approach is implemented
to enhance overall security and maintain the certificate\'s integrity.

The project admins, operators, and tech email addresses associated with
the service are notified about this certificate renewal.

The old certificate remains functional until its expiration date,
allowing for a seamless transition to the new certificate.

## Download the new SSL certificates

The renewed SSL certificate is immediately available for download in the
[Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/),
[API](https://api.aiven.io/doc/), and
[Aiven CLI](/docs/tools/cli) after the
notification.

When accessing the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/) service
page for the Aiven for Apache Kafka service with expiring certificates,
you\'ll be notified with the following message:

![Apache Kafka service user SSL certificate expiring message](/images/products/kafka/ssl-cert-renewal.png)

You can download the new certificate from the [Aiven
Console](https://console.aiven.io/) by:

-   Accessing the Aiven for Apache Kafka service for which you want to
    download the new certificate.
-   Selecting **Users** from the left sidebar.
-   Selecting **Show access key** and **Show access cert** for the
    required user.

:::note
You can download the renewed SSL certificate and key using the
[dedicated Aiven CLI command](/docs/tools/cli/service/user#avn_service_user_creds_download) `avn service user-creds-download`
:::

## Acknowledge the usage of the new SSL certificate

To stop receiving periodic notifications about certificate expiration,
you need to acknowledge that the new certificate has been taken into
use.

To acknowledge the new SSL certificate with the [Aiven
Console](https://console.aiven.io/):

-   Select `...` next to the certificate.
-   Select `Acknowledge certificate`.

:::note
You can acknowledge the renewed SSL certificate using the
[dedicated Aiven CLI command](/docs/tools/cli/service/user#avn_service_user_creds_acknowledge) `avn service user-creds-acknowledge`

The same can be achieved with the Aiven API, using the \"Modify service
user credentials\"
[endpoint](https://api.aiven.io/doc/#operation/ServiceUserCredentialsModify):

``` 
curl --request PUT \
    --url https://api.aiven.io/v1/project/<project>/service/<service>/user/<username> \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer <bearer token>' \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
    --data '{"operation": "acknowledge-renewal"}'
```
