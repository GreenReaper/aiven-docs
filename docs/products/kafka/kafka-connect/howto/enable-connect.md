title: Enable Apache Kafka® Connect on Aiven for Apache Kafka®
---

To enable Apache Kafka® Connect on Aiven for Apache Kafka® services,
those should be running on business or premium plans.

:::warning
Aiven provides the option to run Apache Kafka Connect on the same nodes
as your Apache Kafka cluster, sharing the resources. This is a low-cost
way to get started with Apache Kafka Connect. A standalone Aiven for
Apache Kafka® Connect allows you to scale independently, offers more CPU
time and memory for the Kafka Connect service and reduces load on nodes,
making the cluster more stable.
