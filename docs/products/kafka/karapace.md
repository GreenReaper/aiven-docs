[Karapace](https://karapace.io/) is an Aiven built open-source Schema
Registry for Apache KafkaÂ®, and provides a central repository to store
and retrieve schemas. It consists of a **Schema Registry** and a **REST
API**. All Kafka services on Aiven support both these features (Schema
registry and REST API), and as a user, based on your requirements, you
can enable or disable them.

Karapace supports storing schemas in a central repository, which clients
can access to serialize and deserialize messages. The schemas also
maintain their own version histories and can be checked for
compatibility between their different respective versions. It also
includes support for JSON Schema, Avro and Protobuf data formats.

Karapace REST provides a RESTful interface to your Apache Kafka cluster,
allowing you to perform tasks such as producing and consuming messages
and performing administrative cluster work while using the web language.
