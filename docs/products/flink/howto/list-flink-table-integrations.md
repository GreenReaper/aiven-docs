title: Create Apache Flink® tables using different data sources
---

This section provides information on creating [Apache Flink®
tables](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-stable/docs/dev/table/sql/create/#create-table)
within an Aiven for Apache Flink application using different data
sources such as Apache Kafka®, PostgreSQL®, and OpenSearch®. To build
data pipelines, Apache Flink requires you to map source and target data
structures as Flink tables. The type of data source and the analysis you
want to perform will determine which integration to use.
