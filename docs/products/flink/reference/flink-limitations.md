title: Aiven for Apache Flink® limitation
---

There are likely differences between Aiven for Apache Flink and an
Apache Flink service you run yourself. This is because Aiven for Apache
Flink is a fully managed service. Aiven takes care of the underlying
infrastructure and configuration tasks required to run a stable and
reliable Flink service.

Some of the differences you might see between Aiven for Apache Flink and
a self-managed Flink service include:

-   **User-defined functions:** Aiven for Apache Flink does not
    currently support using user-defined functions (UDFs).
-   **Apache Flink CLI tool:** The Apache Flink® CLI tool is not
    currently supported as it requires access to the JobManager in
    production, which is not exposed to customers.
-   **Job-level settings:** In Aiven for Apache Flink, each job inherits
    the cluster-level settings, and job-level settings are not yet
    supported. You cannot specify separate settings for individual jobs
    within the same cluster.
-   **Flame graphs:** Flame graphs are marked as an experimental feature
    in Apache Flink 1.15 and are not currently enabled in the Aiven for
    Apache Flink web UI.
