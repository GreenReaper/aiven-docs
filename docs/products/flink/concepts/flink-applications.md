title: Aiven for Apache Flink® applications
---

An Aiven for Apache Flink® Application is an abstraction layer on top of
Apache Flink SQL that includes all the elements related to a Flink job
to help build your data processing pipeline. An application contains the
definition of source and sink tables, data processing logic, deployment
parameters, and other necessary metadata.

[Applications](/docs/products/flink/howto/create-flink-applications) are the starting point for running an Apache Flink job
within the Aiven managed service. The [Aiven
Console](https://console.aiven.io/) provides a user-friendly, guided
wizard to help you build and deploy applications, create source and sink
tables, write transformation statements, and validate and ingest data
using the interactive query feature.

Each application created and deployed in the Aiven for Apache Flink
service performs a specific data transformation task allowing you to map
and manage different workflows separately within the Aiven for Apache
Flink service. For example, you can create an application to get user
IDs from one topic and publish them on another topic. You can run
multiple applications within the Aiven for Apache Flink service.

Applications significantly improve the developer experience and simplify
the development and deployment of Flink applications. Applications are
**automatically versioned** on every edit of the underline definition
(tables, or transformation SQL), allowing you to experiment with new
transformations and revert to a previously stored definition if the
result of the edits doesn\'t meet expectations.

## Features of Aiven for Apache Flink applications

Some of key feature of Aiven for Flink applications include:

-   **Intuitive Interface**: The [Aiven
    Console](https://console.aiven.io/) provides a user-friendly, guided
    wizard to help you quickly build and deploy your applications.
-   **Source and sink tables** definition with **SQL autocomplete**: You
    can create source and sink tables, the SQL autocomplete feature
    allows you to start from a specific set of pre-filled parameters
    depending on the type of connector.
-   **Interactive query**: The interactive query feature allows you to
    validate and preview your data in the table or SQL transformation
    before deploying it.
-   **Start and stop**: You can start and stop applications stop and
    start anytime.
-   **Versioning**: By creating a new application version every time you
    edit the table or data transformation definition, you can keep track
    of changes and have the ability to revert to a previous version if
    needed.
-   **Savepoints**: You can stop your application with a savepoint,
    allowing you to restart it from the previous state at a later time.
-   **Scalability:** You can parallelize the workload into multiple
    tasks and executing them concurrently in a cluster

## Limitations

-   **Concurrent applications:** You can create and run up to 4
    concurrent applications in the Aiven for Apache Flink service.
-   **Savepoints:** You can store up to 10 savepoints history per
    application deployment, allowing you to start from a previous state
    if necessary. If you exceed this limit, you must clear the
    savepoints history before creating a new application deployment.

## Aiven for Apache Flink application status

Flink applications can have different statuses based on their current
execution status. The status of a Flink application is closely related
to the state of its savepoints. The most common statuses you will see in
the application on Aiven Console include:

-   **CANCELED:** the application has been stopped without a savepoint.
-   **CREATED:** the application has been created but has yet to start
    running.
-   **FAILED:** the application has failed to run.
-   **FINISHED:** the application has been stopped with a savepoint.
-   **INITIALIZING:** the application is in the process of being
    initialized.
-   **RUNNING:** the application is currently running and can be viewed
    with its version.
-   **RESTARTING:** the application is in the process of being
    restarted.
-   **SAVING_AND_STOP:** the application version is being saved in a
    savepoint, and the application is being stopped.

Other statuses and transient statuses include:

-   **CANCELLING_REQUESTED:** the application is in the process of being
    stopped without a savepoint.
-   **CANCELLING:** the application is in the process of being
    cancelled.
-   **DELETE_REQUESTED:** application has been requested to be deleted.
-   **DELETING:** the application is in the process of being deleted.
-   **FAILING:** the application is in the process of failing.
-   **RESTARTING:** the application is in the process of being
    restarted.
-   **SAVING:** the application is in the process of creating a
    savepoint.
-   **SAVING_AND_STOP_REQUESTED:** the application is in the process of
    creating a savepoint and stopping.
-   **SUSPENDED:** the application has been suspended.
