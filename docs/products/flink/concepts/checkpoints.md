title: Checkpoints
---

Checkpoints in Aiven for Apache Flink® are a key feature for ensuring
resiliency and fault tolerance in stateful functions. By periodically
creating snapshots of the data stream and storing them, checkpoints
enable Flink to quickly and efficiently recover the stream's state and
position in the event of a failure, ensuring that applications can
continue to execute without interruption.

In the event of a failure, Aiven for Apache Flink uses these checkpoints
to restore the application's state and resume processing from the last
recorded reading position, allowing the application to continue as if
the failure had never occurred.

Unlike traditional backups in database systems, rather than creating
full copies of the data, checkpoints function more like recovery logs by
periodically creating snapshots of the data stream and storing them.
