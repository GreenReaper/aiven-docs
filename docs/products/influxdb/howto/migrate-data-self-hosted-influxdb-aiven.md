title: Migrate data from self-hosted InfluxDB® to Aiven
---

You can migrate data from a self-hosted InfluxDB® 1.x service to an
Aiven for InfluxDB® service by exporting the data in line protocol
format using the `influx_export` command from the source service. The
exported file, which is in line protocol format, can then be imported
into the target Aiven for InfluxDB® service using the InfluxDB client.
This process is fast and compatible across different minor versions.

The process of migrating data from a self-hosted InfluxDB to Aiven for
InfluxDB® service can be broken down into two main steps:

1.  Create the data export file
2.  Import the exported data into the destination Aiven for InfluxDB
    service.

## Create the data export file

To export the data from a self-hosted InfluxDB service, you will first
need to run the `influx_inspect export` command. This command will
create a dump file of your data.

The following is an example command: .. code:

    influx_inspect export -datadir "/var/lib/influxdb/data" -waldir "/var/lib/influxdb/wal" -out "/scratch/weather.influx.gz" -database weather -compress

where,

-   `-datadir` and `-waldir` : specifies the directories where your data
    and write-ahead log files are stored, respectively. These paths may
    differ on your system, so double-check your settings before running
    the command.
-   `-out`: specifies where the export file will be saved.
-   `-database`: specifies which database you want to export. In this
    example, the database named `weather` is being exported.
-   `-compress`: implies the command to compress the data.

If you have a large database and only need a specific part of the data,
you can optionally define a time span using the `-start` and `-end`
switches to reduce the dump size. This will make the export process
faster and take up less space.

## Import data into destination Aiven service

Now that you have successfully created the export file, you can proceed
to import it to Aiven for InfluxDB® service by following these steps:

1.  **Ensure a stable network connection:** To ensure a successful data
    transfer, perform the process from a host with a fast and stable
    network connection, such as via VPC peering.
2.  **Pre-create the destination InfluxDB database:** Before you begin
    the data transfer process, you must pre-create the InfluxDB database
    on the destination Aiven for InfluxDB service.
    -   You can do this via the [Aiven
        Console](https://console.aiven.io/) by navigating to the
        **Databases** tab on your InfluxDB service or via the
        [Aiven CLI](/docs/tools/cli) and
        [REST API](https://api.aiven.io/doc/).
    -   Optionally, you can also change the retention policies for the
        destination database. For more information, see
        [InfluxDB retention policies](../concepts/influxdb-retention-policy).

:::note
The `avnadmin` admin user does not have full superuser access, so it is
necessary to pre-create the database before transferring the data.
:::

3.  **Import the data:** You can now push the exported data to the
    destination Aiven service using the `influx -import` command. You
    will need to specify the host, port, username, and password of the
    Aiven for InfluxDB service and the path to the exported data. The
    following is an example command:

    ``` 
    influx -import -host influx-testuser-business-demo.aivencloud.com -port 12691 -username 'avnadmin' -password 'secret' -ssl -precision rfc3339 -compressed -path ./weather.influx.gz
    ```

where,

-   `host`: hostname or IP address of the InfluxDB service where the
    data will be imported.
-   `port`: the port number for the InfluxDB service.
-   `username`: the username for the InfluxDB service.
-   `password`: the password for the InfluxDB service.
-   `ssl`: enables SSL (Secure Socket Layer) for connecting to the
    InfluxDB service.
-   `precision`: sets the timestamp precision for the data being
    imported.
-   `compressed`: the data being imported is in a compressed format.
-   `path`: the path to the file containing the data to be imported.

:::note
During the import process, you might see an error message indicating
that the database could not be created. You can disregard this error
message as the database has already been pre-created before starting the
import process.
:::

After the migration is complete, you can validate your data and start
using your new Aiven for InfluxDB service.
