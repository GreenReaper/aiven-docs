title: Continuous queries
---

Continuous queries run automatically and periodically on real-time data
and store query results in a specified measurement. You can manage
continuous queries using `CREATE CONTINUOUS QUERY` and similar commands.

For more information on Continuous Query commands, see [InfluxQL
Continuous
Queries](https://docs.influxdata.com/enterprise_influxdb/v1.10/query_language/continuous_queries/).

:::note
If you are using the InfluxDBÂ® HTTP API directly, you may need to pass
the name of the database as a URI argument, for example,
`&db=defaultdb`, for some of the management commands to work.
