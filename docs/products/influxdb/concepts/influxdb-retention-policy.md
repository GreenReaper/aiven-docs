title: InfluxDB® retention policies
---

InfluxDB® enforces what is known as **Retention policies** to
automatically manage the lifetime of data points in measurements.

The duration of the default retention policy in Aiven for InfluxDB® data
points is 720 hours, i.e., 30 days. Any data points older than this
(compared to the current time) will be automatically removed. You can
change the retention period, say, 90 days, as per your requirement, and
it will adhere to the modified configuration even after a restart,
migration, or plan upgrade/downgrade.

:::note
The default InfluxDB service user `avnadmin` in Aiven services is not a
full **admin** account (as per InfluxDB terminology), but it has the
capability to manipulate retention policies and continuous queries.
:::

:::note
While you can create databases via the [Aiven
Console](https://console.aiven.io/) or the [REST
API](https://api.aiven.io/doc/), some cluster manipulation commands have
been disabled as they could interfere with Aiven being able to provide
the best service level possible.
:::

You can manage retention policies using the InfluxDB query language
commands:

-   `SHOW RETENTION POLICIES`
-   `CREATE RETENTION POLICY`
-   `ALTER RETENTION POLICY`
-   `DROP RETENTION POLICY`

You can find more about these commands in the [InfluxDB
documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/enterprise_influxdb/v1.10/query_language/manage-database/#retention-policy-management).

:::note
If you are using the InfluxDB HTTP API directly, you may need to pass
the name of the database as a URI argument, for example,
`&db=defaultdb`, for some of the management commands to work.
