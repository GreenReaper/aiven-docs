title: Get started with Aiven for InfluxDB速
---

You can easily create and manage your Aiven for InfluxDB速 service from
the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/). Log in to the console
with your email address and password, and you will see the Services page
that shows all the services available for the selected project.

## Create a new Aiven for InfluxDB速 service

1.  Log in to the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/).

2.  On the **Services** page, click **Create service**. This opens a new
    page with the available service options.

3.  Select **InfluxDB速** from the list of services.

4.  Select the cloud provider of your choice and select the cloud region
    on which you want to run your service.

    :::note
    The pricing for the same service may vary between providers and
    regions. The service summary on the right side of the console shows
    you the pricing for your selected options.
    :::

5.  Next, select the service plan.

6.  Enter a name for your service.

    :::note
    A random name is provided by default, but you can enter a more
    recognizable name to distinguish it from other services. You cannot
    change the name of the service once it is created.
    :::

7.  The **Service Summary** on the right side provides an estimated
    monthly price.

8.  Click **Create service**.

    The **Overview** page for the service opens. This view shows your
    service's connection parameters, its current status, and the
    configuration options. The status is **Rebuilding** while the
    service is being created for you. Once the service is ready, the
    status changes to **Running**. While services typically start up in
    a couple of minutes, the performance varies between cloud providers
    and regions, and it may take longer in some circumstances.
