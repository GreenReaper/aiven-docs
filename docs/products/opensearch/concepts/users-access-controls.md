title: Understanding access control in Aiven for OpenSearch®
---

Implementing access control and permissions is essential in maintaining
secure access to data stored in Aiven for OpenSearch®. This article
provides an overview of how access control works in Aiven for
OpenSearch®, including the different types of permissions that can be
used to control access.

## Patterns and permissions

Access control in OpenSearch is achieved through the use of patterns and
permissions. A pattern is a string in glob-style that specifies the
indices to which the permission applies, while the permission defines
the level of access granted to the user for the matching indices.

### Patterns

Patterns are glob-style strings that use the following syntax:

-   `*`: Matches any number of characters (including none)
-   `?`: Matches any single character

### Permissions

The permissions available in Aiven for OpenSearch®, ordered by
importance, are:

-   `deny`: Explicitly denies access
-   `admin`: Allows unlimited access to the index
-   `readwrite`: Grants full access to documents
-   `read`: Allows only searching and retrieving documents
-   `write`: Allows updating, adding, and deleting documents

### API access

The permission also determines which index APIs the user can access:

-   `deny`: No access
-   `admin`: No restrictions
-   `readwrite`: Allows access to `_search`, `_mget`, `_bulk`,
    `_mapping`, `_update_by_query`, and `_delete_by_query` APIs
-   `read`: Allows access to `_search` and `_mget` APIs
-   `write`: Allows access to `_bulk`, `_mapping`, `_update_by_query`,
    and `_delete_by_query` APIs

:::note
\* When no rules match, access is implicitly denied. \* The `write`
permission allows creating indices that match the rule\'s index pattern
but does not allow deleting them. Indices can only be deleted when a
matching `admin` permission rule exists.
:::

## Example

As an example, consider the following set of rules:

-   `logs_*/read`
-   `events_*/write`
-   `logs_2018*/deny`
-   `logs_201901*/read`
-   `logs_2019*/admin`

This set of rules would allow the service user to:

-   Add documents to `events_2018` (second rule)
-   Retrieve and search documents from `logs_20171230` (first rule)
-   Gain full access to `logs_20190201` (fifth rule)
-   Gain full access to `logs_20190115` (fifth rule, as the `admin`
    permission gets higher priority than the `read` permission in the
    fourth rule)

This same set of rules would deny the service user from:

-   Gain any access to `messages_2019` (no matching rules)
-   Read or search documents from `events_2018` (the second rule only
    grants `write` permission)
-   Write to or use the API `for logs_20171230` (the first rule only
    grants `read` permission)

## Access control for aliases

Access control and aliases are key concepts in OpenSearch. Aliases are
virtual indices that can reference one or more physical indices,
simplifying the management and search of data. You can define access
control rules for aliases to ensure proper security and control over
data access.

When working with aliases in OpenSearch, it\'s essential to remember how
access control rules apply to them:

-   Aliases are not automatically expanded in access control. Therefore,
    the ACL must explicitly include a rule that matches the alias
    pattern.
-   Only access control rules that match the alias pattern will be
    applied, while rules that match the physical indices the alias
    expands to will not be used.

## Access to top-level APIs

You can control access to \"top-level\" APIs in addition to indices
using ACLs. This can be achieved by creating an API-specific rule to
manage access to these APIs.

### Service controlled APIs

The following top-level APIs are controlled by the OpenSearch service
and not by the ACLs defined by you: \* `_cluster` \* `_cat` \* `_tasks`
\* `_scripts` \* `_snapshot` \* `_nodes`

:::note
Enabling OpenSearch Security management provides control over the
top-level APIs - `_mget`, `_msearch`, and `_bulk`.
:::

### Using ACLs to control access

Only rules starting with `_`are considered for controlling access to
top-level APIs, and normal index rules do not grant access to these
APIs. For example, a rule like `*search/admin` only grants access to
indices that match the pattern, not to `_msearch`.

Example:

-   `_*/admin` grants unlimited access to all top-level APIs
-   `_msearch/admin` grants unlimited access to the `_msearch` API only

ACLs **only control access to the API** and not its usage. Granting
access to the top-level API will effectively bypass index-specific
rules. For example, granting `_msearch/admin` access allows searching
any index via the API as the indices to search are defined in the
request body itself.

:::warning
When granting top-level API access via an explicit ACL, the requested
content is not examined.
:::

## Access control and OpenSearch Dashboards

Enabling ACLs does not restrict access to OpenSearch Dashboards.
However, all requests made by OpenSearch Dashboards are checked against
the current user\'s ACLs.

:::note
You might encounter `HTTP 500` internal server errors when you try to
view dashboards as a service user with read-only access to certain
indices, as these dashboards call the `_msearch` API. o prevent this,
add a new ACL rule that grants `admin` access to `_msearch` for that
service user.
