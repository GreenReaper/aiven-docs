title: Get started with Aiven for Apache Cassandra®
---

The first step in using Aiven for Apache Cassandra® is to create a
service. You can do so either using [Aiven
Console](https://console.aiven.io/) or the [Aiven
CLI](https://github.com/aiven/aiven-client).

## Create an Aiven for Apache Cassandra service using the Aiven Console

1.  Log in to the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/).

2.  Follow
    [these instructions](/docs/platform/howto/create_new_service) to create a new Aiven for Apache Cassandra service.

    Once the service is ready, the status changes to *Running*. This
    typically takes a couple of minutes, depending on your selected
    cloud provider and region.

## Create an Aiven for Apache Cassandra service using the Aiven CLI

If you prefer launching a new service from the CLI, [Aiven
CLI](https://github.com/aiven/aiven-client) includes a command for doing
so.

In order to launch a service, decide on the service plan, cloud
provider, and region you want to run your service on. Then run the
following command to create an Aiven for Apache Cassandra service named
`demo-cassandra`:

``` 
avn service create demo-cassandra       \
   --service-type cassandra             \
   --cloud CLOUD_AND_REGION             \
   --plan PLAN                          \
   --project PROJECT_NAME 
```

:::note
See the full list of default flags using the `avn service create -h`
command. Additionally, there are some type-specific options, which you
can see executing the `avn service types -v` command.
