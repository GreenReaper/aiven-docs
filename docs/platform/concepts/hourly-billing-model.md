title: Billing overview
---

In the **Billing** section of the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io), you can manage your [billing groups](/docs/platform/concepts/billing-groups) and [payment methods](/docs/platform/howto/manage-payment-card), and view and download your invoices.

To access billing features, you must be a super admin or account owner.

## Service charges

Services are billed by the hour. The costs are automatically calculated based on
the services running in a project. Each project is charged separately, but the
charges for multiple projects can be consolidated by assigning them to a billing group.


The prices shown in the Aiven console are all-inclusive, meaning that
all of the following are included in the hourly service price:

-   Virtual machine costs
-   Network costs
-   Backup costs
-   Setup costs

While network traffic is not charged separately, your application cloud
service provider may charge you for the network traffic going to or from
their services. Use of PrivateLink and additional storage will incur
additional costs on top of the hourly service usage rate.

The minimum hourly charge unit is one hour. For example, if you create an Aiven service and
power it off after 40 minutes, you are charged for one full hour.


[Terminating or pausing a service](/docs/platform/howto/pause-from-cli) will
stop the accumulation of new charges immediately.
However, the minimum hourly charge unit still applies
before the service is terminated or paused.

Migrating a service to another cloud region or to a different cloud
provider does not incur any additional costs.

## Taxes for Aiven services

Aiven services are provided by Aiven Ltd, a private limited company
incorporated in Finland. Aiven's tax status varies by regions. None
of the marketed prices include value-added or other taxes.

### European Union

Finnish law requires Aiven to charge a value-added tax for services
provided within the European Union (EU). The value-added tax
percentage depends on the domicile of the customer.

For business customers in EU countries other than Finland, we can
apply the reverse charge mechanism of 2006/112/EC article 196 when
a valid VAT ID [is added to the billing information](/docs/platform/howto/use-billing-groups)
for a billing group.

### United States

According to the tax treaty between Finland and the United States (US), no direct tax needs
to be withheld from payments by US entities to Aiven. Although a W-8 form is not required
to confirm this status, Aiven can provide a W-8BEN-E form describing its status. Contact
the sales team at [sales@aiven.io](mailto:sales@aiven.io) to request one.

Aiven does charge US sales taxes in several states. The applicability of these taxes
depends on various factors, such as the taxability of Aiven services and tax thresholds.

### Rest of the world

No EU value-added tax is applied to services sold outside the EU as described in the
Value-Added Tax Act of Finland section 69h. Finland has tax treaties with most countries
in the world affirming this status. Aiven reserves the right to charge any  taxes required
by the customer's local tax legislation.
