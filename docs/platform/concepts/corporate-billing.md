title: Payment methods overview
---

Payment methods give you the flexibility to choose how you pay for the charges made to each [billing group](/docs/platform/concepts/billing-groups). Each billing group can have a different payment method, and you can use the same payment method across multiple billing groups.

## Payment cards

The default billing method for all new Aiven customers is credit card. You
[add a payment card](/docs/platform/howto/manage-payment-card) and then add it to a billing
group. All costs accrued over a calendar month for the projects assigned to the billing
group are automatically charged to that payment card on the first day of the following month.

### Credit card fees

The prices on the Aiven website and in your invoices include all credit card and processing
fees related to the charges that are visible to and payable by Aiven. This includes transaction
fees with the credit card processor, Stripe, and the fees that card issuers charge from merchants.

Some credit card issuers add extra charges on top of these fees. The most common fee is an
international transaction fee. Some issuers add this charge for all transactions where the native
country of the merchant (for Aiven, Finland) and processor (for Aiven, the United States)
bank and card are different. The fee may even be applied if the card was charged in the its
default currency (USD).

These fees are not added by Aiven. They are not visible to Aiven or our credit card processor,
so we're unable to include them in our prices or waive them.

## Bank transfers

Customers who have at least 1,000 USD in monthly recurring revenue (MRR) can
[request to pay their invoices by bank transfer](/docs/platform/howto/pay-by-bank-transfer).
With this payment method enabled, your billing contacts get monthly invoices in PDF format by
email. These invoices are generated at the end of the month based on actual usage.

Prices for Aiven services are always in US dollars, but invoices can also be sent in the
following currencies. Invoices in different currencies are created based on the exchange rates
on the date of the invoice.

- Australian dollars
