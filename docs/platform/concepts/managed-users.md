title: Managed users

:::important
Managed users is an
[early availability feature](/docs/platform/concepts/beta_services). To use it,
[enable the feature preview](/docs/platform/howto/feature-preview) in your user profile.
:::

The managed users feature provides a centralized way of managing all of
your organization\'s users, including editing their profiles, resetting
passwords, and
[setting authentication policies](/docs/platform/howto/set-authentication-policies).

When you
[verify a domain](/docs/platform/howto/manage-domains), existing organization users automatically become managed
users.

A managed user cannot create new organizations unless they are a super
admin of the organization that they are managed by.

To see a list of all users in your organization go to **Admin** and
select **Users**.
