title: Disaster recovery testing scenarios
---

[Disaster Recovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_recovery)
(DR) is the ability of software and/or services to handle extreme
scenarios; this could be the failure of the software itself or an outage
within a datacenter.

These situations are uncommon but can have a huge impact, so they need
to be prepared for. Aiven provides this service to any Enterprise
Support customers and can run these scenarios at your request up to 4
times per year.

## What is a Disaster Recovery scenario?

This is a preset scenario where an Aiven specialist will simulate an
issue with your service and `sabotage` one (or more) of your Virtual
Machines. For example, with an Aiven for PostgreSQLÂ® service, we can
`sabotage` the Primary instance and test the failover functionality or
we can sabotage both nodes to test recovery time for a complete outage.

## What is needed?

1.  At least 7 working days notice and the time (plus timezone) that you
    would like this carried out.
2.  A `throwaway` service (i.e. one that is created specifically for
    this scenario and not a service used in Production).
3.  The virtual machine and/or the availability zone that you would like
    to target.
4.  An Enterprise Support contract.

## How do we request this?

You can request this by opening a support ticket, emailing
[support@Aiven.io](mailto:support@aiven.io) or by contacting your
Customer Success Manager.

## How is it run?

-   All communication during the exercise will occur in the support
    ticket.
-   We will contact you to confirm the start of the scenario, the
    actions we will take and the service affected. The scenario will not
    begin until it is confirmed by you.
-   Actions taken on the service and/or virtual machines will be
    communicated through the support ticket.
