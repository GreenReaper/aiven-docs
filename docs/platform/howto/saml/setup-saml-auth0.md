title: Set up SAML with Auth0
---

This article explains how to set up SAML with
[Auth0](https://auth0.com/) for an organization in Aiven. For more
information on SAML and instructions for other identity providers, see
the
[Set up SAML authentication](/docs/platform/howto/saml/saml-authentication) article.

## Prerequisite steps in Aiven Console

1.  In the organization, click **Admin**.
2.  Select **Identity providers**.
3.  Click **Add identity provider**.
4.  Enter a name and select SAML. You can also select the groups that
    users will be added to when they sign up or log in through this
    authentication method.

You are shown two parameters needed to set up the SAML authentication in
Auth0:

-   Metadata URL
-   ACS URL

## Configure SAML on Auth0

1.  Log in to [your Auth0 account](https://manage.auth0.com).

2.  Select **Applications**.

3.  Click **Create Application**.

4.  Enter an application name.

5.  Choose **Regular Web Applications** and click **Create**.

6.  After your application is created, go to the **Addons** tab.

7.  Enable the **SAML 2 WEB APP** option.

8.  Click on the **SAML 2 WEB APP** option. The **Settings** tab opens.

9.  Set the `Application Callback URL` to the `ACS URL` from the Aiven
    Console.

10. In the **Settings** section for the Application Callback URL, remove
    the existing configuration and add the following field mapping
    configuration:

    ``` shell
    {
      "email": "email",
      "first_name": "first_name",
      "identity": "email",
      "last_name": "last_name",
      "mapUnknownClaimsAsIs": true
    }
    ```

11. Click **Enable** and **Save**.

12. On the **Usage** tab, make a note of the
    `Identity Provider Login URL`, `Issuer URN`, and
    `Identity Provider Certificate`. These are needed for the SAML
    configuration in Aiven Console.

## Finish the configuration in Aiven

Go back to the **Authentication** page in [Aiven
Console](https://console.aiven.io/) to enable the SAML authentication
method:

1.  Select the name of the Auth0 method that you created.
2.  In the SAML configuration section, click **Edit**.
3.  Add the configuration settings from Auth0:
    -   Set the `SAML IDP URL` to the `Identity Provider Login URL` from
        Auth0.
    -   Set the `SAML Entity ID` to the `Issuer URN` from Auth0 .
    -   Paste the certificate from Auth0 into the `SAML Certificate`
        field.
4.  Click **Edit method** to save your changes.
5.  Toggle on **Enable authentication method** at the top of the page.
6.  In the **Signup and link accounts URLs** section, copy the
    appropriate link and send it to your users to switch them to the new
    IdP:
    -   **Signup URL**: For users that don\'t have an Aiven user account
        and need to create a new Aiven user linked to this IdP.
    -   **Account link URL**: For users that already have an Aiven user
        account to link their existing Aiven user with the configured
        IdP.

:::note
If you set up a SAML authentication method before and are now switching
to a new IdP, existing users need to log in with the new account link
URL to finish the setup.
