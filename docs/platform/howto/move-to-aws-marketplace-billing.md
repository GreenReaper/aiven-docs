title: Move from Aiven direct billing to AWS Marketplace
---

Aiven makes its services available through the AWS Marketplace. If you
already have some services running in a project which is billed directly
through Aiven but you would like to move to an AWS Marketplace
subscription without disrupting your services, this article shows the
steps needed to gather the relevant information and submit the request.

## Set up an AWS Marketplace subscription for Aiven

Follow the steps to
[set up AWS Marketplace for Aiven services](billing-aws-marketplace-subscription). This will create a new Aiven organization, which is where
your projects will be moved to.

## Gather the required information

Aiven will need some information from both your existing user account
and your new subscription in order to perform the migration.

**From your existing Aiven user account:**

-   The name of the Aiven projects that have the services you wish to
    move.

**From your new Aiven organization with the AWS marketplace
subscription:**

-   The name of the new organization.

## Send the request to Aiven
