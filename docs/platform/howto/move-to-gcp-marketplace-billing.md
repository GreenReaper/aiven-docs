title: Move from Aiven direct billing to Google Cloud Platform Marketplace
---

Aiven makes its services available through the Google Cloud Platform
Marketplace. If you already have some services running in a project
which is billed directly through Aiven but you would like to move to a
Google Cloud Platform Marketplace subscription without disrupting your
services, this article shows the steps needed to gather the relevant
information and submit the request.

## Create a new account using a Google Cloud Platform Marketplace subscription

Follow the steps to
[set up Google Cloud Platform Marketplace for Aiven Services](billing-google-cloud-platform-marketplace-subscription). This will create a new Aiven organization, which is where
your project will be moved to.

## Gather the required information

Aiven will need some information from both your existing and new
subscriptions in order to perform the migration.

**From your existing Aiven account:**

-   The name of the Aiven project (or projects) that contain the
    services you wish to move.

**From your new Aiven organization with the GCP marketplace
subscription:**

-   Your new Aiven organization name, as shown in the [Aiven GCP
    console](https://console.gcp.aiven.io/).

## Send the request to Aiven

Once you have collected the information above, send it by email to
[sales@aiven.io](mailto:sales@aiven.io) and someone will be in touch to complete the process.
