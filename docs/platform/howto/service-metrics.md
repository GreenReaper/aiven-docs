title: Access service metrics
---

Service metrics are essential for monitoring and evaluating how well
your services perform. They provide valuable information about how your
services utilize resources, their efficiency, and their overall health.
By tracking and analyzing service metrics, you can make data-driven
decisions, identify potential issues, and optimize the performance of
your services.

## Available service metrics

The service metrics available in [Aiven
Console](https://console.aiven.io/) include the following:

-   **CPU usage:** Shows the percentage of CPU resources consumed by the
    service.
-   **Disk space usage:** Represents the percentage of disk space
    utilized by the service.
-   **Disk iops (reads):** Indicates the input/output operations per
    second (IOPS) for disk reads.
-   **Disk iops (writes):** Indicates the input/output operations per
    second (IOPS) for disk writes.
-   **Load average:** Shows the 5-minute average CPU load, indicating
    the system's computational load.
-   **Memory usage:** Represents the percentage of memory resources
    utilized by the service.
-   **Network received:** Indicates the amount of network traffic
    received by the service, measured in bytes per second.
-   **Network transmitted:** Indicates the amount of network traffic
    transmitted by the service, also measured in bytes per second.

## View service metrics

[Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/) provides a user-friendly
interface for accessing service metrics. Follow these steps to retrieve
the metrics:

1.  Log in to [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/).

2.  Go to the **Services** page for your project, and select the service
    you want to review.

3.  In the **Overview** page of your service, select **Metrics** from
    the sidebar.

4.  In the **Metrics** page, choose the desired period for which you
    want to retrieve the metrics. The available options are as follows:

    -   **Hour:** Last hour metrics, updated every 30 seconds
    -   **Day:** Last day metrics, updated every 5 minutes
    -   **Week:** Last week metrics, updated every 30 minutes
    -   **Month:** Last month metrics, updated every 3 hours
    -   **Year:** Last year metrics, updated daily

    :::note
    The selected period is relative to the current date and time. For
    instance, when you select the **Hour** option, it retrieves metrics
    for the last hour.

:::note[Push service metrics to another service within the Aiven platform]
To further enhance your
[monitoring capabilities](/docs/platform/howto/monitoring-services), you can **Enable metrics integration** and establish a
connection to push service metrics to an M3, InfluxDB®, or PostgreSQL®
service within the Aiven platform. This integration allows you to
conveniently send your service metrics to an existing service or create
a new one dedicated to receiving and storing the metrics.
