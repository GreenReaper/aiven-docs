title: Create service integrations
---

If you\'re not sure what a service integration is, see
[Service integration](/docs/platform/concepts/service-integration) for an overview. This article will guide you on how to
create service integrations between different Aiven services and move
telemetry data using these integrations.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need three services:

-   Service that produces the telemetry data. We\'re using an Aiven for
    Apache Kafka® service in our example, but this could be one of the
    other Aiven services available.
-   Aiven for PostgreSQL® - Database where the telemetry data is stored
    and can be queried from
-   Aiven for Grafana® - Dashboards for the telemetry data

## Create an integration

1.  In the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/),
    [create new services](create_new_service) including Aiven for Apache Kafka®, Aiven for
    PostgreSQL®, and Aiven for Grafana®. Choose your preferred cloud
    provider, region, and a plan from **startup**, **business**, or
    **premium**.

2.  Once all three services are running in the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/), select the Aiven for
    PostgreSQL service from the **Services** page. Ensure you are on the
    **Overview** page of your service.

    a.  Select to **Integrations** from the sidebar.
    b.  Under **Aiven solutions**, click **Monitor Data in Grafana**.
    c.  In the **Datasource integration** window, select the **Existing
        service** radio button and choose the Aiven for Grafana service
        you created.
    d.  Click **Enable**.

3.  To enable metrics from the Aiven for Apache Kafka service, go to the
    **Overview** page of your Aiven for PostgreSQL service.

    a.  Select **Service integrations** from the sidebar.
    b.  Under **Aiven solutions**, select **Receive Metrics**.
    c.  In the **Metrics integration** window, ensure the **Existing
        service** radio button is selected and choose the Aiven for
        Apache Kafka service.
    d.  Click **Enable**.

    :::note
    This step allows advanced Aiven for Apache Kafka telemetry data to
    flow into the Aiven for PostgreSQL service.
    :::

4.  To view the Aiven for Apache Kafka metrics data in Grafana:

    a.  In the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/), select your
        Aiven for Grafana service from the **Services** page.
    b.  In the **Connection information** section on the service
        **Overview** page, copy the **Service URI** from the
        **Connection information** to access the Grafana service in your
        browser.
    c.  Log in using the credentials provided in the **Connection
        information** section (the `avnadmin` user and the password).

:::note
If you don\'t see a dashboard after logging in, search for
`Aiven Kafka - <YOUR_KAFKA_SERVICE_NAME> - Resources` from the top-left
corner in the Grafana console. This is a predefined dashboard
automatically maintained by Aiven.
:::

:::note
Data may take a minute to appear on the dashboard if you\'ve just
enabled the integrations. Refresh the view by reloading the page from
the top-right corner. You can create custom dashboards either from
scratch in Grafana or by saving a copy of the predefined dashboard under
a different name that does not start with *Aiven*.
:::

:::warning
Any modifications to the predefined dashboard will be automatically
overwritten by the system in time.
