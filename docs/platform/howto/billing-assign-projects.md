title: Assign projects to billing groups
---

When you create a new project, you can assign it to a billing group,
which lets you
[use the same payment card and consolidate costs](/docs/platform/concepts/billing-groups). You can also assign the project to another billing group
later in the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/) using the
instructions in this article.

:::note
Projects can only be assigned to one billing group. If a project is
already assigned to one billing group and you assign it to another, it
will be removed from the first group.
:::

To assign projects to a billing group:

1.  In the project, click **Billing**.
2.  Select the billing group you want to assign the project to.
3.  Click the **Projects** tab.
4.  Click **Assign projects**.
5.  Select the projects to assign to this billing group and click
    **Assign projects**.
6.  Click **Cancel** to close the dialog box.

You will see the newly assigned projects listed in this billing group.
