title: Set up AWS Marketplace subscriptions
---

Aiven makes its services available through the Amazon AWS Marketplace.
This article shows the steps needed to create a subscription that links
the accounts.

First, there are some steps that need to be completed on the AWS
Marketplace page before heading over to the Aiven Console and finishing
the process.

## AWS Marketplace setup

1.  Search for \"Aiven Managed Database Services\" on the [AWS
    Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-vylwtm6t2c7fk).
    This page contains information about all of Aiven\'s services and
    how the marketplace subscription works. Click the **View purchase
    options** button on this page.

2.  When you are ready, click the **Subscribe** button on the page. You
    will NOT be charged by clicking this button; this only sets up a
    billing subscription between AWS and Aiven. You will only be charged
    after deploying Aiven services.
3.  Click **Set up your account**. This takes you to the Aiven Console
    to complete the process.

4.  You should now be on the AWS signup page at Aiven, asking you to
    sign up or log in.
5.  After registering or logging in, choose or create an Aiven
    organization to use the AWS subscription for. If you have any
    existing Aiven projects that you want to be moved to this AWS
    subscription, this organization name is the one you will need for
    that.

If you have any issues linking Aiven to your AWS subscription, you can
try the process again in the AWS web console by finding the Aiven
subscription and clicking **Set up your account**.

:::note
The URL that you log in to for your AWS subscription is
[https://console.aws.aiven.io](https://console.aws.aiven.io). This is different from the Aiven Console
([https://console.aiven.io](https://console.aiven.io)).
