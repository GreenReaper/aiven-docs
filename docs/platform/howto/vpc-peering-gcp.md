title: Set up Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) peering on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
---

Once you\'ve created a
[VPC on the Aiven platform](manage-vpc-peering), you can follow these instructions to set up VPC peering on
GCP.

1.  Open your GCP Console.

2.  Select **VPC Networks** and find the VPC that you want to connect
    to.

3.  Click the project name, and make note of the **Project ID**.

4.  Under **VPC Network**, make note of the **VPC Network Name**.

5.  In [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io), select **VPCs** from
    the sidebar on the **Services** page.

6.  On the **Virtual private clouds** page, select the VPC connection
    that you created.

7.  In the **VPC Peering connections** view, enter the GCP project ID
    (step 3) into the **GCP project ID** field and the exact GCP VPC
    network name (step 4) into the **GCP VPC network name** field. Next,
    select **Add peering connection**.

    This adds a new connection with the *Pending Peer* status.

    :::note
    Select the blue **Pending peer** icon, and make a note of the Aiven
    project ID and the VPC network name.
    :::

8.  In your GCP Console, go to **VPC** \> **VPC network peering**, and
    select **Create peering connection**.

9.  To create a peering connection, take the following steps:

    1.  Enter a name for the peering connection.
    2.  Under **Peered VPC network**, select **In another project**.
    3.  Enter the Aiven project ID and the VPC network name identified
        in step 7 in Aiven Console.

10. Click **Create**.

When the peering is successful, it is active in both [Aiven
Console](https://console.aiven.io) and your GCP Console.
