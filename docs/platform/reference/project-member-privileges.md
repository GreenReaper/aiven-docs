title: Project member roles
---

User permissions are assigned at the project level by role. Each user
added to a project - individually or as part of a
[group](/docs/platform/howto/manage-groups) - becomes a project member and is assigned a role for that
project.

You can grant different levels of access to project members using roles:

-   **Admin**: Full access to the project and its services.

    -   This role is automatically granted to users who create a
        project.
    -   Does not have access to organization settings such as billing.
    -   Can add and remove project members.

    :::note
    Every project must have at least one admin user.
    :::

-   **Operator**: Full access to all services in the project.

    -   Can create new services.
    -   Cannot make changes to the project members.

-   **Developer**: Allowed to manage services in this project.

    -   Can make changes to services and databases, for example:
        creating databases, connecting to databases, removing Aiven for
        OpenSearch® indexes, creating and modifying Aiven for Apache
        Kafka® topics, and creating and modifying Aiven for PostgreSQL®
        connection pools.
    -   Can create and change service database users.
    -   Cannot make changes to the project members.
    -   Cannot make changes that affect billing (such as powering
        services on or off).

-   **Read-only**: Only allowed to view services.

    -   Cannot make any changes to the project or its services.
